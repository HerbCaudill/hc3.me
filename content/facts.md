Herb wrote the first version of DevResults in 2009. Much of that code has since been rewritten by better programmers.

A data-visualization geek, a graphic designer, and a programmer, he has been building websites and software for international development organizations since 2000. Herb grew up in Panama and Ecuador, and worked in Africa for 5 years, first teaching high-school math with the Peace Corps in Gabon and Guinea, and then working on internet initiatives with USAID.

Herb lives in Barcelona with his wife and two young boys. These days his heroes include Mike Bostock, Edward Tufte, and Idelfons Cerdà. He is currently working on language #7 (Catalan) and has been trying to learn this Prokofiev Sonata for 27 years now.
